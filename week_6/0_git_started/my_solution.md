## Release 4: Git Workflow

I set the recommended shortcuts on www.gitimmersion.com  
My workflow
1. gs (my shortcut for git status)
2. ga . (if i'm adding all files worked on, otherwise ga <filename>)
3. gs (double check to make sure i have everything lined up to commit)
4. gc -m "My commit message" (a shortcut for git commit)  
when done  
5. git push origin master

## Release 5: Reflection  
www.gitimmersion.com was a huge help for me. I started working on it a week or 2 ago,
and just finished it today (should have finished it waaay earlier). I like learning
through many short examples. I feel pretty comfortable using git now. I still need
more experience moving between branches, but it seems like that happens more on group
projects.
